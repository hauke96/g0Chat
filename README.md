[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hauke96/g0Chat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hauke96/g0Chat)
# g0Ch@
g0Ch@ (spoken "go chat") is a simple chat server written in go (unfortunately github does not allow @ in the repo name thats why the repo is called `g0Chat` and not `g0Ch@` :/). This repo also contains a terminal client which does only work in linux.

The chat is a **linux only** application, it'll probably *not* run on Windows and *maybe* on Mac. Same for the server which *might* also run on Windows and Mac, but there's **no guarantee**.

## Public server
There's a public server available with the IP `188.68.53.201`. If you're lucky, you'll find me in the channel `dev`.

## How to build
### Normally
Just execute the build script via `sh compile.sh`. Windows and Mac user may do this manually.

### With docker
In [852a8d8](https://github.com/hauke96/g0Chat/commit/852a8d85355ad2d0927bdaac6be465f5860c73d1) I added a `Dockerfile` and a build script to create a docker image so that you can run the server inside a docker container.

## How to start the server
### Normally
Simply execute the `g0Ch@_server` file and the server will start on port 44494 by default (for parameters s. "Server Parameter" below). When it doesn't, check the output of it (so better run the server in a terminal ;) ).

### With docker
Just `cd` into the g0Ch@ directory and execute `sh dockerize.sh` to create the image. After that use `docker run -p 44494:44494 --name g0chat-server g0chat_server` to start the server and `docker kill g0chat-server` to kill it (need to be run in separate terminal).

The `-p` parameter specifies the mapping of container- and host-port. You can write `<hostPort>:<containerPort>` with e.g. `123:44494` then the g0Ch@ server is available over the port `123` via the host server.

Add a `&` after the run-command to run the server in background, no separate terminal will be needed to kill the server with this method.

## How to start the client
Simply execute the `g0Ch@_client` file, choose on username and enter the server data (IP, port).

## Parameter
There'er some parameter like `-l`, that allows you to specify the amount of messages that are stored locally (and that are also displayed) and `-h, --help` that shows the help page.

All parameters can be used with the syntax [parameter]=[value], e.g. `--username=Hugo` and there's also a short term for those long parameters (it's always the first letter, so `-u=Hugo` would be equivalent to the one before).
### Client Parameter
* `-u, --username : `The username/nickname.
* `-i, --ip       : `The IP of the g0Ch@ server.
* `-p, --port     : `The port of the g0Ch@ server (usually 44494).
* `-l, --limit    : `Value for the size of the message buffer (how many messages are stored). The default is 50.
* `-c, --channel  : `The channel you want to talk in.
* `-h, --help     : `Shows this kind of list.

The `-l` or `--limit` can also be used without value. In this case you will be asked for a value before you can enter a chatroom. If the parameter is not given, the default value of 50 will be used.

### Server Parameter
* `-p, --port     :`Defines a custom port. The default one (used by not using this parameter) is 1000.0

### How to chat
Seriously?^^ Get a live lol

### How to leave the chat
Simply enter `exit` as message and everything will be fine. Cancelling the chat with `Ctrl+C` may have unwanted effects on your terminal (nothing to worry about, so just try it out to see what happens --> s. below).

## Protocol
Every package has a prefix (which is not `0x04` and not `0x1f`) a main part and a postfix which is allways `0x04`. Between logical parts of each package is a separator (`0x1f`).

This is `version 1.0` of the g0C@ protocol.
### Client -> Server
The client send very simple packaged of data to the server. The packages have the following structure:
```
0x00<message>0x04               - send normal message
0x01<username>0x1f<channel>0x04 - sign in
0x02<username>0x04              - sign out
```

### Server -> Client
The server receives a message and sends it back to all users in the given channel as well as to the sender of the message. There're different packages for different purposes:
```
0x00<username>0x1f<message>0x04 - normal message
0x01<username>0x04              - sign in
0x02<username>0x04              - sign out
0x03<message>0x04               - server shut down
```
The `0x04` char is not used as prefix due to possible problems in reading and parsing the package.
## Problems
### Terminal hacking
It's not a bug or something, it's just not fancy. At the moment I have to kind of hack the terminal with `stty` to be able to grab typed characters before the user presses enter.

Let's say a user writes a sentence, while doing so, a message comes in, the screen becomes cleared and the message is printed onto the screen. Normally the users input is gone now. It's buffered (so available for the internal system) but not visible anymore.

To prevent this, I have to disable buffering, grab characters directly when they are typed and display them manually. And this is ugly I think. If there's a better method out there, please let me know or commit a pull request.
